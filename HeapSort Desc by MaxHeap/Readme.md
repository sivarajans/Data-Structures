# Heap Sort
Max Heap Invarient data structure is used to sort.

1. Do max heap invarient structure.
2. Swap last element with root 
3. Pop last element (which is root) that has maximum value.

## Zero Based Index Formula:
*All the parent = floor(n / 2) - 1* -- here n is total elements.

*Child-1 of parent = 2i + 1* -- here i is index (0 based)
*Child-2 of parent = 2i + 2*
