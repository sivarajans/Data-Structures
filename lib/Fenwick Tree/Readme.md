# Fenwick Tree
General tree used for range queries. It works with bits for positional sum up and todo range queries. 

The highest element responsible can be found using 
*Bits(n) + Least Significant Bits(n)*


Same way the lowest element responsible for range query can be found using
*Bits(n) - Least Significant Bits(n)*
