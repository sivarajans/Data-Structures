# Heap Sort - Ascending Order 
Min Heap Invarient data structure is used.

1. Do min heap invarient structure.
2. Swap last element with root 
3. Pop last element (which is root) that has minimum value.

## Zero Based Index Formula:

*All the parent = floor(n / 2) - 1* -- here n is total elements.

*Child-1 of parent = 2i + 1* -- here i is index (0 based)  
*Child-2 of parent = 2i + 2*
